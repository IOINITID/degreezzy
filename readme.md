## What is it? üê±

It is a library with utilitarian functions for working with degrees and directions.

## How to use it?

First you need to install the package from npm:

```
npm install --save degreezzy
```

After that, you need to import the package into your project:

```
import { getDirectionByDegrees, getDegreesByDirection } from 'degreezzy';
```

Now you can use this in your project, for example:

```
const degrees = 360; // Degrees value.

const direction = getDirectionByDegrees(degrees); // Returns a direction value: 'N';
```

You can also:

```
const direction = 'N'; // Direction value.

const degrees = getDegreesByDirection(direction); // Returns a degrees value: 360;
```

There are also functions for converting radians to degrees.

```
import { getDegreesByRadians, getRadiansByDegrees } from 'degreezzy';
```

Which you can use that way.

```
const radians = 6.283185307179586; // Radians value.
const degrees = getDegreesByRadians(radians); // Returns a degrees value: 360.
```

Or degrees to radians.

```
const degrees = 360; // Degrees value.
const radians = getRadiansByDegrees(degrees); // Returns a radians value: 6.283185307179586.
```
